PINKVANITY — Hackathon (24h) MVP (Chrome extension)

MVP A: Vanity sizing (fit helper)
- Target sites: American Eagle, ZARA, H&M.
- On product page: detect/extract size chart (or link to it) and normalize units.
- User provides (once): bust/waist/hips (or “I’m usually size ___ in ___ brand”).
- Output: recommended size + “why” (which measurements matched) + confidence (High/Med/Low).
- Optional: user saves “fit good / too small / too big” for that brand locally.

MVP B: Pink tax (value checker)
- Target sites: American Eagle, ZARA, H&M.
- Category focus (apparel basics on these sites): tees, hoodies/sweatshirts, jeans, socks.
- On product page: show price and key attributes (category, materials, features if available).
- Compare: user selects a men’s/unisex “equivalent” product URL (same site) for side-by-side.
- Output: % price difference + “comparability checklist” (same brand/site, similar materials, similar item type) + confidence.

Shared (must-have guardrails)
- Privacy-first: no accounts; store settings locally; no browsing-history collection.
- Transparency: always show inputs + assumptions; label estimates clearly.
- Performance: only run on supported domains; don’t block page interaction.

If time
- Save recent checks (local history).
- “Better value” suggestions list (same site/search results).

Not doing (24h)
- Multi-site crawling, universal sizing prediction, price history tracking, or server-side pipelines.
